# Discord VC Elevator
**~~Annoy~~ Elevate your friends!**

You are in a voice call with your friends but it got really quiet and depressing? Well, this bot will fix that!

With one simple command you can let the bot move a friend of your choosing into a _building_ (a stack of voice-Channels meant to represent its floors) and let him be _elevated_. The bot will play elevator-music and do other things I have yet to come up with...

## Initial Setup:
- **pull** the repo into an empty folder on a device of your choosing
- **create** a file called **TOKEN.env** and add your Discord-API token to it (it needs to look like this: TOKEN = "_your token here_") 
- run the **installer.bat** file
- you need to setup a stack of voice channels that follow this naming-scheme (the first channel-name is the upper most floor): "n OG", "n-1 OG", ... , "EG", "1 UG", ... "m UG"

## Running the bot
- simply run the **launcher.bat** file
